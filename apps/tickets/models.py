"""
Models for ticket holds and bookings.

This module defines two core models used during the ticket purchasing
workflow: ``Hold`` and ``Booking``. ``Hold`` records a temporary
reservation of seats for a specific event, optionally linked to a user.
``Booking`` represents a confirmed or pending purchase of one or more
seats for an event. Together they help prevent double booking of
seats and provide a record of completed purchases.
